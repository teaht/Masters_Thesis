LBSU Softball Pitching Analytics

This project details the development of an analysis tool to assess pitcher performance using play-by-play data from public PDFs. The steps involved in the project are as follows:

Data Collection & Dataset Creation:
I began by scraping publicly available play-by-play PDFs, transforming them into structured data to form a dataset containing approximately 11,000 rows. This data includes detailed information on pitch types, pitch locations, batter outcomes, and more.

Data Analysis:
With the dataset in hand, I analyzed the relationship between pitch type, pitch location, and the corresponding batter outcomes (e.g., strikeouts, hits, etc.). The aim was to identify patterns that could highlight a pitcher’s strengths and areas for improvement. 

Models Used: logistic regression, decision tree, ranadom forest, domain adaptation

Insight Generation:
Based on the analysis, I generated reports to help identify key areas where pitchers need to improve their performance and what types of pitches are working best for them. These insights were designed to offer actionable recommendations for coaching and strategy.

Results:
The project delivers data-driven insights into how different pitch types and locations influence batter outcomes, providing a comprehensive evaluation of pitcher performance.
